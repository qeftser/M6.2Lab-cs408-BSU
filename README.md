# M 6.2 Lab Caleb Pollock

## Usage

Because this project is using javascript, packages should be installed before running:

```
npm install 
```

You can either view the website through the vscode live preview plugin or by using
a web browser and opening the index.html file.

## Discussion

This project was nice in that we had a little more freedom to get things done. I
feel like I got close to the example, but only if you view the webpage in half
size. This is alright I guess, as it is meant to be a letter that is more that
format. Using random text is a nice way to do things. It allows me to focus
on the layout and those kind of things without thinking about the text.    
    
I have the label tags for my radio buttons and used the correct tags for 
what I think is everything so this website should be pretty accessable. 
Not much is happening so it wasn't that bad this time.
